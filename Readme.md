# Chroma Key with OpenCV
![movie (2)](https://github.com/JonysArcanjo/ChromaKey_OpenCV/assets/48812740/c5ebe01c-aa07-4ceb-a385-4fe65e9095c6)

## About the Project

This project uses computer vision techniques to manipulate and combine two videos: a main video and a background video. It extracts pixels from the main video that correspond to a specific range of green colors and replaces them with the corresponding pixels from the background video. The result is displayed in real-time.

[Detailed article about the project.](https://jonysarcanjo.medium.com/chroma-key-com-opencv-eb3118dee66)

## Project Structure
- Readme.md
- data
  - fundo_canva.mp4
  - shakira_modnet_com.mp4
- main.py
- requirements.txt

## Libraries Used

The following libraries are used in this project:
- OpenCV (cv2): Used for image and video processing.
- Numpy

## Application in Production

This computer vision project can be applied in various applications, such as:

1. Video Conferencing: It can be used to replace the background of a main video during video calls, providing a virtual background.
2. Augmented Reality: By replacing the green color with virtual objects or scenes, it can enhance the augmented reality experience.
3. Special Effects: It can be used in video production to add special effects or merge multiple video sources.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of computer vision techniques to replace a specific color range in a main video with the corresponding pixels from a background video. It can be extended and customized based on specific requirements and applications.
